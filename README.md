# ⚡ Getting Started

## 🔋 Installation

To get started with the ZenML Dashboard, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js (v18):**
   - Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can either install version 18 directly or use [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) with the following commands:

     ```bash
     nvm install 18
     nvm use 18
     ```

2. **Install Yarn:**
   - The project uses Yarn as the package manager. Install it with:

     ```bash
     npm install -g yarn
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

     ```bash
     yarn install
     ```

4. **Set Environment Variable:**
   - Configure the environment variable `REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL` by replacing `<YOUR_ZENML_SERVER_DEPLOYMENT_URL>` with your ZenML Server deployment URL. Example:

     ```bash
     export REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL="https://your-zenml-server-url/api/v1"
     ```

5. **Run Development Server:**
   - For development, run the server with:

     ```bash
     yarn start
     ```

   - Alternatively, build the project for production with:

     ```bash
     yarn build
     ```

6. **Using Docker (Optional):**
   - ZenML provides Docker images for the server and dashboard. Run the following command to serve both:

     ```bash
     docker run -it -d -p 8080:80 zenmldocker/zenml-server
     ```

   - Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8080` with the username `default` and an empty password.

For detailed deployment instructions and additional options, refer to the [deployment guide](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide/switch-to-production).

Now you're ready to explore and visualize your ML pipelines, stacks, and artifacts with the ZenML Dashboard!


# 🤝 ZenML Dashboard Integration

The ZenML Dashboard is a Javascript React-based application designed to seamlessly integrate with the main [ZenML Python package](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml). It serves as a unified platform for managing and visualizing your ML pipelines, stacks, and artifacts in one centralized location.

## Integration Overview

The ZenML Dashboard is intricately connected with the ZenML Server as its backend and is not intended for standalone use. Here's a brief overview of how it fits into the ZenML ecosystem:

- **Sister Repository:**
  - The dashboard resides in this repository, acting as a sister repository to the main [ZenML Python package repo](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml).

- **Bundled Build Files:**
  - The dashboard build files are bundled into the [ZenML PyPi package](https://pypi.org/workspace/zenml/) and are included with each version of the ZenML Python package. These build files, generated by `yarn build`, correspond to specific versions of the dashboard.

- **Local Deployment:**
  - Serve the static build files locally using the ZenML Python package:

    ```bash
    zenml up
    ```

    This creates a local daemon that serves the files in a [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) server.


## 🪐 Deploying the dashboard

You can deploy this dashboard on supported cloud providers with ZenML python package by using the command:

```
zenml deploy
```

The above command deploys the dashboard in the [same process as the ZenML Server](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide/switch-to-production) and automates a lot of the nitty-gritty for you.

However, the option to deploy standalone is also available. `yarn build` creates a build directory with a production build of the dashboard. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html. Here are [8 ways to deploy a React app for free](https://blog.logrocket.com/8-ways-deploy-react-app-free/) as a starting point.

Just don't forget to set the `REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL` environment variable!
