# ⚡ Getting Started

## 🔋 Installation

The installation is as follows:

First, there is a pre-requisite to use [`node`](https://www.npmjs.com/) version 14.20.0 exactly. One can do this by installing the [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) utility and then doing

```
nvm install 14.20.0
nvm use 14.20.0
```

Users also need to have [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

Then you can run it by doing:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

To build it:

```
yarn build
```

The app takes the following env variables:

```
REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL="<YOUR_ZENML_SERVER_DEPOLOYMENT_URL>/api/v1"
```

To learn how to get the `YOUR_ZENML_SERVER_DEPOLOYMENT_URL`, read the [deployment guide](https://docs.zenml.io/platform-guide/set-up-your-mlops-platform/deploy-zenml).

Lastly, if you would like to use Docker, then the ZenML team provides [DockerHub] images to serve the ZenML Server and Dashboard in one image:

```shell
docker run -it -d -p 8080:80 zenmldocker/zenml-server
```

Which will serve the dashboard with the server at `http://localhost:8080`, with username `default` and an empty password.

## 👨‍👦 Relationship with ZenML

The ZenML Dashboard is a Javascript React-based application that lives inside this repository, which is a sister repository of the main [ZenML Python package repo](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml).

> **Note** - The ZenML Dashboard is meant to be used with the ZenML Server as a backend and cannot be used standalone.

The dashboard build files come bundled into the [ZenML PyPi package](https://pypi.org/workspace/zenml/) and can be [served locally](https://docs.zenml.io/platform-guide/set-up-your-mlops-platform/deploy-zenml/deploy-with-zenml-cli) and/or [deployed on the cloud](https://docs.zenml.io) through the main ZenML python package.

Basically, each ZenML `Python` package comes with the build files (generated by `yarn build`) of a certain version of this dashboard (all build files of the dashboard can be seen in the [releases](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-dashboard/releases) section of this GitHub repo). Therefore, each ZenML PyPi package has bundled in it a corresponding version of this dashboard.

With the `Python` package, you can then serve these static build files by doing:

```
zenml up
```

![img](./assets/zenml-up.gif)

Which creates a local daemon that serves the files in a [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) server!

## 🪐 Deploying the dashboard

You can deploy this dashboard on supported cloud providers with ZenML python package by using the command:

```
zenml deploy
```

The above command deploys the dashboard in the [same process as the ZenML Server](https://docs.zenml.io/platform-guide/set-up-your-mlops-platform/deploy-zenml), and automates a lot of the nitty gritties for you.

However, the option to deploy standalone is also available. `yarn build` creates a build directory with a production build of the dashboard. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html. Here are [8 ways to deploy a React app for free](https://blog.logrocket.com/8-ways-deploy-react-app-free/) as a starting point.

Just don't forget to the set the `REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL` environment variable!
