# ‚ö° Getting Started

## üîã Local Installation

To get started with the ZenML Dashboard, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js (v20):**

   - Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can either install version 18 directly or use [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) with the following commands:

     ```bash
     nvm install 20
     nvm use 20
     ```

2. **Install Pnpm:**

   - The project uses Pnpm as the package manager. Install it with:

     ```bash
     npm install -g pnpm
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   - Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

     ```bash
     pnpm install
     ```

4. **Set Environment Variable:**

   - Configure the environment variable `VITE_API_BASE_URL` by replacing `<YOUR_ZENML_SERVER_DEPLOYMENT_URL>` with your ZenML Server deployment URL. Example:

     ```bash
     export VITE_API_BASE_URL="https://your-zenml-server-url/api/v1"
     ```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The frontend and the server-url needs to be on the same domain, e.g. `localhost` for local development

> [!NOTE]  
> For local development you **don't** need to set `VITE_FEATURE_OS_KEY`
> You can set the `VITE_FRONTEND_VERSION` to a version number, e.g `v0.17.0`. This value is used to read the UI Version from the environment

5. **Run Development Server:**

   - For development, run the server with:

     ```bash
     pnpm dev
     ```

   - Alternatively, build the project for production with:

     ```bash
     pnpm build
     ```

6. **Using Docker (Optional):**

   - ZenML provides Docker images for the server and dashboard. Run the following command to serve both:

     ```bash
     docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 --name zenml zenmldocker/zenml-server
     ```

   - Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8080`

For detailed deployment instructions and additional options, refer to the [deployment guide](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide/switch-to-production).

Now you're ready to explore and visualize your ML pipelines, stacks, and artifacts with the ZenML Dashboard!

# ü§ù ZenML Dashboard Integration

The ZenML Dashboard is a Typescript React-based application designed to seamlessly integrate with the main [ZenML Python package](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml). It serves as a unified platform for managing and visualizing your ML pipelines, stacks, and artifacts in one centralized location.

## Integration Overview

The ZenML Dashboard is intricately connected with the ZenML Server as its backend and is not intended for standalone use. Here's a brief overview of how it fits into the ZenML ecosystem:

- **Sister Repository:**

  - The dashboard resides in this repository, acting as a sister repository to the main [ZenML Python package repo](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml).

- **Bundled Build Files:**

  - The dashboard build files are bundled into the [ZenML PyPi package](https://pypi.org/workspace/zenml/) and are included with each version of the ZenML Python package. These build files, generated by `yarn build`, correspond to specific versions of the dashboard.

- **Local Deployment:**

  - Serve the static build files locally using the ZenML Python package:

    ```bash
    zenml up
    ```

    This creates a local daemon that serves the files in a [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) server.
